# Measures

## Sleep features

We considered 13 sleep features, organised into three domains:

| Domain           | Feature                               | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                          |

† Measured over the four weeks prior to each outcome assessment.\
‡ Measured as the change between the four weeks before the current
outcome assessment (T2) and the four weeks before the previous outcome
assessment three months ago (T1)

Each feature was derived based on information collected in the 4 weeks
prior to the 3-monthly outcome assessment. For features measuring a
change in sleep (e.g., Δ total sleep time), we calculated the difference
between sleep over the past 4 weeks and sleep in the same period at the
previous outcome assessment:

![](figures/explain_windows.png){fig-align="center"}

### Derivation of daily sleep features

-   Sleep was continuously recorded by FitBit devices and summarised as
    a daily measure.

-   On most days, participants had a single 'sleep event' (i.e., a
    continuous episode of sleep). However, on around 10% of days
    participants recorded multiple sleep events. On those days, we used
    information for the primary sleep event only, identified as the
    largest continuous sleep event. Shorter sleep events (e.g., naps)
    were discarded.

Most sleep features were derived directly from the FitBit data (e.g.,
total hours of sleep), but some required further processing:

-   **Onset latency** refers to the time between going to bed and
    falling asleep (sleep onset). We derived this by combining
    information on sleep with information on physical activity.
    Specifically, we defined onset latency as the period between the
    last step recorded (via FitBit) and the onset of sleep (via FitBit).

![](figures/deriving_onset_latency.png){fig-align="center"}

### Derivation of sleep features in the four weeks before each outcome assessment

-   We derived sleep features by summarising the daily measures over the
    four weeks before each 3-monthly outcome assessment. Each feature
    represented the median or variance of the available daily values.

-   We used information for weekdays only (with the exception of "social
    jetlag") to avoid overestimating variability due to differences
    between weekdays versus weekends.

-   At each 3-monthly assessment, we included participants who provided
    sleep information on at least 8 (non-consecutive) weekdays over the
    previous four weeks. We chose a minimum of 8 weekdays to provide
    reliable summaries whilst minimising selection bias (participants
    wearing their FitBit for more than eight days tended to have lower
    depressive symptoms and more stable sleep patterns).

-   "Social jet lag" was calculated as the difference in the mean sleep
    midpoints for weekdays versus weekends.

## Covariates

We considered four covariates measured at enrolment:

-   Male gender (0/1);
-   Partnership status (0/1);
-   Years of age (continuous);
-   Years of education (continuous).

And four covariates measured repeatedly at each three-monthly outcome
assessment:

-   Atypical depression subtype;
-   Current medication use;
-   Alcohol use;
-   Hours of daylight;

### Atypical depression

Following @novick2005, we defined 'atypical depression' based on
consensus-selected items of the IDS-SR (Inventory of Depressive
Symptomatology Self-Report). To be classified as atypical, participants
needed to report (1) a score of 0-2 for 'mood reactivity'; *and* (2) at
least two of the following symptoms:

1.  Leaden paralysis (a score of 2-3);
2.  Weight gain *or* increased appetite (a score of 2-3);
3.  Hypersomnia (a score of 2-3);
4.  Interpersonal sensitivity (a score of 3).

### Current medication use

At enrolment and each 3-monthly assessment, participants were asked to
list medication they were currently taking as part of the Client Service
Receipt Inventory (CSRI).

After correcting typographical errors, we categorised each medication
based on expert opinion into three categories:

1.  **Depression-related**
    -   Antidepressants
    -   Antipsychotics
    -   Anticonvulsants
2.  **Sleep-related**
    -   Benzodiazepines
    -   Hypnotics
3.  **Other**

These were entered into the models as three binary variables (0/1)
indicating whether the participant was currently using each type of
medication.

### Alcohol use

Alcohol use was measured using the total score on the Alcohol Use
Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT).

### Hours of daylight

To account for seasonal differences in sleep and mood, we adjusted for the 
mean hours of sunshine in the four weeks before each three-monthly outcome 
assessment.

Information from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) was extracted from
UNdata[^un] for three cities corresponding to the three RADAR-MDD sites:

WMO city                                RADAR-MDD site
--------------------------------------  --------------------
De Bilt, Utrecht, The Netherlands.      Amsterdam
London Gatwick, London, United Kingdom. King's College London
Madrid, Spain                           CIBER Madrid

WMO define hours of sunshine as the period during which direct solar irradiance
exceeds 120 watts per square meter. This value is equivalent to the level of solar irradiance shortly after sunrise or shortly before sunset in cloud-free conditions.

# Modelling

## Standardisation and transformation of sleep features

All sleep features were standardised (mean = 0; standard deviation = 1)
prior to modelling. Three features that measured variance were
additionally log-transformed to improve estimation and MCMC sampling:

-   Total sleep time variance;

-   Sleep onset latency variance; and

-   Sleep midpoint variance.

Three features were winsorised by setting extreme values to specified
limits:

-   Sleep midpoint (winsorised at midday);

-   Social jet lag (winsorised at ±5 hours)

## Prior distributions

We used weakly informative priors for the regression coefficients,
following McElreath @mcelreath2020, to constrain our estimates to
plausible values.

For example, for binary logistic regression models, we specified a prior
of a $\text{Normal}(0, 1.5)$ for the regression coefficients (i.e.,
normally distributed with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.5),
reflecting our expectation that extreme values were unlikely. For a one
standard deviation difference in a given sleep feature, we do not think
it is plausible to find an odds ratio of greater than 12 (i.e., a
log-odds of 2.5) or less than 0.08 (a log-odds of -2.5).
