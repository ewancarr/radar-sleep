## Derivation of sleep features

We considered 13 sleep features organised into three domains:

| Domain           | Feature                                 | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                              | Derivation of sleep feature                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

^†^ Measured over the four weeks prior to each outcome assessment.\
^‡^ Measured as the change between the four weeks before the current
outcome assessment (T~2~) and the four weeks before the previous outcome
assessment three months ago (T~1~)

Each sleep feature was derived using information collected in the four
weeks prior to each 3-monthly outcome assessment. For features measuring
a change in sleep (e.g., Δ total sleep time), we calculated the
difference between sleep over the past 4 weeks and sleep in the same
period at the previous outcome assessment:

![](figures/explain_windows.png){fig-align="center"}

### Derivation of daily sleep features

The included sleep features are described in the table above. These
features have previously been defined by Zhang et al., [-@zhang2021] in
an existing analysis of RADAR-MDD.

Sleep parameters were continuously recorded by Fitbit devices. From this
information, we derived aggregate daily summaries for each participant
during follow-up.

On most days, participants had a single 'sleep event' (i.e., an episode
of sleep starting with 'sleep onset' and ending with 'sleep offset').
However, on around 10% of days participants recorded multiple sleep
events. On those days, we used information for the primary sleep event
only, identified as the largest continuous sleep event. Shorter sleep
events (e.g., naps) were discarded.

Almost all sleep features were derived directly from the daily Fitbit
data (e.g., total hours of sleep). One feature, **onset latency**,
required further processing:

**Onset latency** refers to the time between going to bed and falling
asleep (sleep onset). Since 'time of going to bed' was not provided by
Fitbit, we instead derived this information by combining information
from Fitbit on sleep and physical activity. Specifically, we defined
onset latency as the period between the last step recorded (based on
physical activity information provided by Fitbit) and the onset of sleep
(defined in the table above). This is illustrated below:

![](figures/deriving_onset_latency.png){fig-align="center"}

### Derivation of sleep features in the four weeks before each outcome assessment

From the daily aggregate measures, we derived sleep features summarising
sleep over the four weeks prior to each 3-monthly outcome assessment.
Each feature represented the median or variance of the available daily
values.

At each 3-monthly assessment, we included participants who provided
sleep information on at least 8 (non-consecutive) days over the previous
four weeks. We chose a minimum of 8 days to provide reliable summaries
whilst minimising selection bias (participants wearing their Fitbit for
more than eight days tended to have lower depressive symptoms and more
stable sleep patterns).

## Covariates

We considered four covariates measured at enrolment:

-   Male gender (0/1);
-   Partnership status (0/1);
-   Years of age (continuous);
-   Years of education (continuous).

And four covariates measured repeatedly at each three-monthly outcome
assessment:

-   Atypical depression subtype;
-   Current medication use;
-   Alcohol use;
-   Hours of daylight;

### Atypical depression

Following @novick2005, we defined 'atypical depression' based on
consensus-selected items of the IDS-SR (Inventory of Depressive
Symptomatology Self-Report). To be classified as atypical, participants
needed to report (1) a score of 0-2 for 'mood reactivity'; *and* (2) at
least two of the following symptoms:

1.  Leaden paralysis (a score of 2-3);
2.  Weight gain *or* increased appetite (a score of 2-3);
3.  Hypersomnia (a score of 2-3);
4.  Interpersonal sensitivity (a score of 3).

### Current medication use

At enrolment and each 3-monthly assessment, participants were asked to
list medication they were currently taking as part of the Client Service
Receipt Inventory (CSRI).

After correcting typographical errors, we categorised each medication
based on expert opinion into three categories:

1.  **Depression-related**
    -   Antidepressants
    -   Antipsychotics
    -   Anticonvulsants
2.  **Sleep-related**
    -   Benzodiazepines
    -   Hypnotics
3.  **Other**

These were entered into the models as three binary variables (0/1)
indicating whether the participant was currently using each type of
medication.

### Alcohol use

Alcohol use was measured using the total score on the Alcohol Use
Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT).

### Hours of daylight

To account for seasonal differences in sleep and mood, we adjusted for
the mean hours of sunshine in the four weeks before each three-monthly
outcome assessment.

Information from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) was
extracted from UNdata[^1] for three cities corresponding to the three
RADAR-MDD sites:

[^1]: <http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=CLINO&f=ElementCode%3a15>

| WMO city                                | RADAR-MDD site        |
|:----------------------------------------|:----------------------|
| De Bilt, Utrecht, The Netherlands.      | Amsterdam             |
| London Gatwick, London, United Kingdom. | King's College London |
| Madrid, Spain                           | CIBER Madrid          |

WMO define hours of sunshine as the period during which direct solar
irradiance exceeds 120 watts per square meter. This value is equivalent
to the level of solar irradiance shortly after sunrise or shortly before
sunset in cloud-free conditions.

# Computing

## Software

All analyses were conducted in R 4.2.3. The main packages used were:

-   [`brms`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=brms) 2.18;

-   [`cmdstanr`](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/) 0.5.3, using
    [CmdStan](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/cmdstan) 2.32.0;

-   [`tidyverse`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tidyverse) 2.0.0;

# Modelling

## Transformation and trimming of sleep features

Three sleep features measuring variability were log-transformed to
improve estimation and MCMC sampling:

-   Total sleep time variance;

-   Sleep onset latency variance; and

-   Sleep midpoint variance.

Two features were winsorised by setting extreme values to specified
limits:

-   Sleep midpoint (winsorised at midday);

-   Social jet lag (winsorised at ±5 hours)

## Centering and standardisation of sleep features

Following Curran and Bauer [-@curran2011], all sleep features were
person-mean centred. For each participant and each sleep feature, this
involved subtracting the mean of their repeated assessments (throughout
follow-up) from each the current value of the sleep feature (for the
current 3-month period). For example, suppose an individual participated
at five follow-up assessments, where their total sleep time was recorded
as:

$$
\text{Total sleep time} = \left [ \begin{array}{rrrrr} 5.3, & 7.4, & 4.9, & 6.3, & 7.5 \end{array} \right ]
$$

Their mean across the five assessments would be $6.3$ hours, and their
person-mean centred values would be:

$$
\text{Total sleep time}_{\text{Person-mean centred}} = \left [ \begin{array}{ccccc}  -1.0, & 1.1, & -1.4, & 0.0, & 1.2 \end{array} \right ]
$$

After centring, we then standardised the centred values by dividing by
the standard deviation of the sample (separately for the 'depression
relapse' and 'depression severity' samples).

## Prior distributions

We used weakly informative priors for the regression coefficients,
following McElreath @mcelreath2020, to constrain our estimates to
plausible values.

For example, for binary logistic regression models, we specified a prior
of a $\text{Normal}(0, 1.5)$ for the regression coefficients (i.e.,
normally distributed with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.5),
reflecting our expectation that extreme values were unlikely. For a one
standard deviation difference in a given sleep feature, we do not think
it is plausible to find an odds ratio of greater than 12 (i.e., a
log-odds of 2.5) or less than 0.08 (a log-odds of -2.5).

### Priors for binary logistic regression models

```{r, cache.lazy = FALSE}

                           "2023-05-05-16-15_relmod.rds"))

print(prior_summary(fit$relmod$fit[[1]], all = FALSE), show_df = FALSE)
```

### Priors for linear regression models

```{r, cache.lazy = FALSE}

                        "2023-05-06-17-11_ids.rds"))

print(prior_summary(fit$ids$fit[[1]], all = FALSE), show_df = FALSE)
```

# Posterior summaries

```{r Select models to plot}
#| echo: true
sel_ids <- fit$ids |>
  filter(y == "ids_total",
         adj != "")
